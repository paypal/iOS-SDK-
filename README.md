# PayPal iOS SDK

Welcome to PayPal's iOS SDK. This library will help you accept card, PayPal, Venmo, and alternative payment methods in your iOS app.

## FAQ
### Availability
The SDK is currently in the development process. This product is being developed fully open source - throughout the development process, we welcome any and all feedback. Aspects of the SDK _will likely_ change as we develop the SDK. We recommend using the SDK in the sandbox environment until an official release is available. This README will be updated with an official release date once it is generally available.

### Contribution
As the SDK is moved to general availability, we will be adding a contribution guide for developers that would like to contribute to the SDK. If you have suggestions for features that you would like to see in future iterations of the SDK, please feel free to open an issue, PR, or discussion with suggestions. If you want to open a PR but are unsure about our testing strategy, we are more than happy to work with you to add tests to any PRs before work is merged.

## Support

The PayPal iOS SDK supports a minimum deployment target of iOS 13+ and requires Xcode 13.2+ and macOS Big Sur 11.3+. See our [Client Deprecation policy](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/docs/guides/client-sdk/deprecation-policy/ios/v5) to plan for updates.

### Package Managers

* CocoaPods
* Swift Package Manager

### Languages

### UI Frameworks
This SDK supports:

* UIKit
* SwiftUI

## Access Token

The PayPal SDK uses access tokens for authentication.

> The following example can be adapted to any server-side language/framework of your choice. We use command-line curl requests to demonstrate the overall composition of the Access Token HTTP request.

To create an access token:

1. Follow the steps in [Get Started](https://developer.paypal.com/api/rest/#link-getstarted) to obtain a client ID and secret from the PayPal Developer site.
1. Make an HTTP request with Basic Authentication using client ID and secret to fetch an access token:

**Request**
```bash
# for LIVE environment
curl -X POST https://api.paypal.com/v1/oauth2/token \
-u $CLIENT_ID:$CLIENT_SECRET \
-H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
-d 'grant_type=client_credentials&response_type=token&return_authn_schemes=true'

# for SANDBOX environment
curl -X POST https://api.sandbox.paypal.com/v1/oauth2/token \
-u $CLIENT_ID:$CLIENT_SECRET \
-H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
-d 'grant_type=client_credentials&response_type=token&return_authn_schemes=true'
```

:warning:&nbsp;Make sure the environment variables for `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` are set.

**Response**

```json
{
  "scope": "...",
  "access_token": "<ACCESS_TOKEN>",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "app_id": "...",
  "expires_in": 32400,
  "nonce": "..."
}
```

Use the value for `access_token` in the response to create an instance of `CoreConfig` to use with any of the SDK's feature clients.

## Modules

Each feature module has its own onboarding guide:

- [Card](docs/Card)
- [PayPalUI](docs/PayPalUI)
- [PayPal Native Checkout](docs/PayPalNativeCheckout)
- [PayPal Web Checkout](docs/PayPalWebCheckout)

To accept a certain payment method in your app, you only need to include that payment-specific submodule.

## Sample Code

```swift
// STEP 0: Fetch an ACCESS_TOKEN and ORDER_ID from your server.

// STEP 1: Create a PaymentConfiguration object
paymentConfig = PaymentConfig(token: ACCESS_TOKEN)

// STEP 2: Create payment method client objects
cardClient = CardClient(config: paymentConfig)

// STEP 3: Collect relevant payment method details
card = Card(number: 4111111111111111, cvv: 123, ...)

// STEP 4: Call checkout method
cardClient?.checkoutWithCard(orderID: ORDER_ID, card: card) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let orderId):
      // Send orderID to your server to process the payment
    case .error(let error):
      // handle checkout error
    }
}

// STEP 5: Send orderID to your server to capture/authorize

```


## Testing

This project uses the `XCTest` framework provided by Xcode. Every code path should be unit tested. Unit tests should make up most of the test coverage, with integration, and then UI tests following.

This project also takes advantage of `Fastlane` to run tests through our CI and from terminal.
In order to invoke our unit tests through terminal, run the following commands from the root level directory of the repository:
```
bundle install
bundle exec fastlane unit_tests
```

If you would like to get the code coverage for all of the modules within the `iOS-SDK`, run the following:
```
bundle install
bundle exec fastlane coverage
```

### CI

GitHub Actions CI will run all tests and build commands per package manager on each PR.

### Local Testing

TBD until development progresses. We will use Rake, Fastlane, or some other tool for easy command-line build tasks.

## Release Process

This SDK follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). The release process will be automated via GitHub Actions.

## Analytics

Client analytics will be collected via Lighthouse/FPTI.
